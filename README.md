Log errors via WP_DEBUG. Create, view and clear debug.log file.

## Description

Debug Log Manager allows you to: 

* **enable [WP_DEBUG](https://wordpress.org/support/article/debugging-in-wordpress/) with one click** to log PHP and database errors when you need to, and disable it when you're done. No need to manually edit wp-config.php file. 
* **create the debug.log file for you** in a non-default location with a custom file name for better security.
* parse the debug.log file and **view distinct errors and when they last occurred**, which is better then looking at the raw log file (potentially) full of repetitive errors. 
* **quickly find and filter more specific errors** for your debugging work.
* **easily clear the debug.log file** to save disk space and more easily observe newly occurring errors on your site.

A more compact version of Debug Log Manager is included as part of the [System Dashboard plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/system-dashboard/), should you prefer a single plugin that does more.
